# ANAGRAMS API Documentation
 
This API could be the backend for a game where the users would be able to get random strings, submit all corresponding anagrams they think are correct and also produce basic statistics for each users (for a leaderboard for instance).

As instructed the API is based on the following technologies : the Serverless Framework, NodeJS, Serverless Function (AWS Lambda) and a MySQL DB (AWS RDS). 

This description has purposedly been kept very short as the challenge instructions are already explaining the required features of the API.

Please reply with a link to a public repository containing your solution within one week of receiving the task, and get in touch if you have any questions. Include a discussion of anything that you found challenging, explanation of design decisions you took and what you would add given more time. You needn't spend more than a few hours on this, we are more interested in seeing how you approach the task than receiving a finished product.

### Features

The API we build has three main functionalitites : 

  1. Generating a random string of 6 characters that has at least 1 anagram available
  2. Receiving a user input (array of anagrams) and checking it against the Anagramica's API
  3. Generating a statistical report of for any user

Users having not yet played the game

#### Potential Extra Features

- Adding a leaderboard function where users can compare they stats
- Designing a GUI and making the project full stack including stats visualisation for users
- Further improve the random string generator so it nevers produces words from the dictionary

## Challenges

1. NodeJSE
I had never used NodeJS before this project although I had a decent understanding of Javascript and APIs calls. 
Indeed I had the opportunity to use API calls based on user input and push them to a UI in the racefinder project I have done : https://github.com/raphaelzenou/racefinder . Thankfully Node is very well thought and the community around it is vast and incredibly helpful.

2. Serverless
I simply and plainly discovered the Serverless concept, framework and AWS Lambda offering and therefore the learning curve combined with Node was quite steep right at the start of this project however I found helpful the Serverless documentation, UI and video tutorials to get my project off the ground quickly.

The serverless concept in general is a fascinating concept and AWS offering is extremely fast and cost effective compared to traditional server offering for equivalent REST APIs powered by Node and Express for instance. As I have learned with the DB timeout issues the Serverless technology also has some limitations.

3. Async / Await 

Because the last time I had to use the concept of asynchronous execution I used JQuery and Ajax I did not have to worry to much about promises or call back and all the specifics of this type of programming. For this project I had to make sure to truly understand the concepts in order to be able to use them in my NodeJS functions especially long executuon functions such as DB queries, API calls or the while loop in Generate. 


## Technologies Used

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
    - **Node.js** is the project's server-side Javascript execution environement (backend)
- [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/)
    - **Serverless** that simplifies AWS serverless Lambda functions setup and deployment
    - Serverless requires Node 6 or higher
    - additional modules to keep in mind : https://github.com/pmuens/awesome-serverless 
- [Serverless Offline module](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline)
    - **Serverless Offline** emulates AWS Lambda on local machines to speed up development
- [Request-Promise module](https://github.com/request/request-promise)
    - **Request-Promise** is a simplified HTTP request client 'request' with Promise support
- [Serverless-MySQL module](https://github.com/jeremydaly/serverless-mysql)
    - **Serverless MySQL** promised based version of the well known mysql ORM module
    - Serverless MySQL adds a connection management component to the mysql module that is designed specifically for use with serverless applications
    - Supports all standard mysql module queries : https://github.com/mysqljs/mysql#performing-queries
- [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
    - **AWS Lambda** is a serverless application development cloud solution
- [AWS RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/)
    - **AWS RDS** is a cloud based MySQL relational database 


##Â Design Decisions

In this projet async/await has been implemented instead of callbacks to managed processed taking time such as DB Queries, API calls or long loops (while loop in the generate function for instance). I 

## Deployment

Deployment is made thanks to the Serverless Framework and its .yml file containing all required settings to deploy our Anaggrams app on AWS Lambda from the CLI combined with Serverless' web dashboard. The MySQL database is provided by AWS (RDS) too.

Unfortunately there seems to be a timeout parameter issue with AWS Lambda preventing the MySQL requests to be carried out whereas they run perfectly well locally using serverless offline.

I thought I found a lead in the article below (See 'ES2017 Features') but async/await works well for the API calls but the article is now outdated.

I am still digging the issue and will try to get in touch with AWS customer service if I don't find a resolution.



User submissions should be stored in a MySQL database.

## Endpoints


1. **Random string Generator (anagram friendly)**

The user is presented with a random 6 characters strin.


- METHOD : GET 
- ENDPOINT :  /generate
- LOCAL URL : http://localhost:3000/generate
- AWS URL : https://w14l64z000.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/generate

- API SAMPLE RESPONSE :
{
	"generatedString": "sinla"
}

- VALIDATION :

/best (GET)
http://www.anagramica.com/best/:letters
Returns:
   {best:[<word1><,word2><,word3><...>]}



2. **User submission**

The user submits the following array of anagrams: ["snail", "sailn"] via a post request.
The submission including the user ID and random string and the results will be store in a single row in the DB.
The user the receives a response that they scored x points of y possible anagrams.
In our example the user scored 1 point :  "snail" was correct, but "sailn" is incorrect.


- METHOD : POST
- ENDPOINT : /validate
- LOCAL URL : http://localhost:3000/validate
- AWS URL : https://w14l64z000.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/validate

- USER SUBMISSION BODY

{
	"userId": "xxx",
	"generatedString": "sinla",
	"anagrams": ["snail", "sailn"]
}

- API SAMPLE RESPONSE

    {
        "totalScore": 3,
        "score": 1,
        "anagrams": ["snail", "nails", "slain"],
        "correct": ["snail"],
        "incorrect": ["sailn"]
    }

- VALIDATION : 
  The following API has been used to validate user submissions:
  http://www.anagramica.com/api



3. **User statistics**

The user can get personal statistics by simply passing on its user UD in the url (path), see below path variable {userId}.
The API then responds with aggregated data on the user: number of submissions, max possible score and effective user score.

- METHOD : GET

- ENDPOINT : /statistics/{userId}
- LOCAL URL : http://localhost:3000/statistics/{userId}
- AWS URL : https://w14l64z000.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/statistics/{userId}

- API SAMPLE RESPONSE

    {
        "numberOfSubmissions": 1,
        "totalAvailableScore": 3,
        "totalUserScore": 0,
    }

## Testing

The three functions have been tried and tested locally thanks to Serverless Offline.

Unfortunately only the generate function has been tested on Amazon as it was not impacted by the timeout issue impacting the other functions involving DB connection and queries.

Only manual testing has been carried out so far.
